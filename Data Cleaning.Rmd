## Introduction

The purpose of the following report is the analysis of the 'global shark attacks' dataset. The dataset was retrieved from http://www.sharkattackfile.net/ on 29.03.2020 and contains current and historical data on shark/human interactions. Our goal is to better understand the behavior of the sharks and to test a few hypotheses.

### Data Import

```{r}
library(readxl)
shark <- read_excel("GSAF5.xls")

View(shark[1:20,])
str(shark)
```

### Data Cleaning

First we will investigate, clean and prepare every single variable in the dataset. This is an important step because we want to see what kind of data we are dealing with and prepare it accordingly for further analysis.




### Analysis and Imputation of Missing Values
