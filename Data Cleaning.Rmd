## Introduction

The purpose of the following report is the analysis of the 'global shark attacks' dataset. The dataset was retrieved from http://www.sharkattackfile.net/ on 29.03.2020 and contains current and historical data on shark/human interactions. Our goal is to better understand the behavior of the sharks and to test a few hypotheses.

### Data Import

```{r}
library(readxl)
shark <- read_excel("GSAF5.xls")

library(data.table)
DT_shark<-as.data.table(shark)

View(shark[1:20,])
str(shark)
```

### Data Cleaning

First we will investigate, clean and prepare every single variable in the dataset. This is an important step because we want to see what kind of data we are dealing with and prepare it accordingly for further analysis.

#### Case Number

We have 3 variables with case numbers. Do they contain the same values?

```{r}

table(shark$`Case Number...1` == shark$`Case Number...20`)
table(shark$`Case Number...1` == shark$`Case Number...21`)
table(shark$`Case Number...20` == shark$`Case Number...21`)

library(stringr)
DT_shark[,Date:=str_replace_all(DT_shark[,Date], "(Reported)", " ")]
library(lubridate)
DT_shark[,Date:=dmy(Date)]
DT_shark[,Date_M:=month(Date)]
DT_shark[,Date_Y:=year(Date)]
DT_shark[,Time_hm:=hm(Time)]

View(DT_shark[,c("Time","Time_hm")])
# Morning, Afternoon etc, gehen verloren


# unique(DT_shark[,Type])
# unique(DT_shark[,Country])
# unique(DT_shark[,Area])
# unique(DT_shark[,Location])
# unique(DT_shark[,Activity])
# unique(DT_shark[,Sex])
# unique(DT_shark[,Age])
# unique(DT_shark[,Injury])
# unique(DT_shark[,`Fatal (Y/N)`])
# unique(DT_shark[,`Investigator or Source`])
# DT_shark[, .N, by = Type]
# DT_shark[, .N, by = Country]
# DT_shark[, .N, by = Area]
# DT_shark[, .N, by = Location]
# DT_shark[, .N, by = Activity]
# DT_shark[, .N, by = Sex]
# DT_shark[, .N, by = Age]
# DT_shark[, .N, by = Injury]
# DT_shark[, .N, by = `Fatal (Y/N)`]
# DT_shark[, .N, by = `Investigator or Source`]
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = Type],-N))
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = Country],-N))
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = Area],-N))
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = Location],-N))
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = Activity],-N))
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = Sex],-N))
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = Age],-N))
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = Injury],-N))
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = `Fatal (Y/N)`],-N))
View(setorder(DT_shark[, .N, by = `Investigator or Source`],-N))


str(DT_shark)

```

The majority of them do. Because we have no further information about their differences, we will only use the case number 1 and delete the other ones.

```{r}
names(shark)[names(shark) == "Case Number...1"] <- "Case" # renaming the column name
shark <- subset(shark, select = -c(`Case Number...20`, 
                                   `Case Number...21`,
                                   `...23`,
                                   `...24`)) # delete unnecessary columns
```
